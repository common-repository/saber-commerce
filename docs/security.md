## User Capability Checks

### TO DO

* Run tests on lower user roles like author to see what type of access they might have. Expect most or all functions to be blocked by the submenu registration to manage_options.
* Implement current_user_can() checks through components.
* Establish a log that can be used to trace any malicious user or hacker actions.
